# 🌩️ Spring Cloud 2024 Fundamentals

Welcome to the **Spring Cloud 2024 Fundamentals** repository! This project is a hands-on, modular, and modern approach to mastering the core components of the Spring Cloud ecosystem. It is designed for developers building scalable, resilient, and cloud-native microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

## 📦 Modules & Technologies

This project covers the following Spring Cloud components and related tools:

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🧭 **Spring Cloud Gateway** | API Gateway for routing and filtering requests |
| 🗺️ **Spring Cloud Config** | Centralized configuration management |
| 🧪 **Spring Cloud Sleuth** | Distributed tracing for microservices |
| 📊 **Spring Cloud Zipkin** | Visualization of traces collected by Sleuth |
| 🧬 **Spring Cloud Eureka** | Service discovery and registration |
| 🧰 **Spring Boot Admin** | Monitoring and managing Spring Boot apps |
| 🔐 **Spring Cloud Security** | OAuth2 and JWT-based security for microservices |
| 📡 **OpenFeign** | Declarative REST client for inter-service communication |
| 🧵 **Resilience4j** | Circuit breaker, rate limiter, and fault tolerance |
| 🧭 **Spring Cloud Bus** | Propagate config changes across services via messaging |
| 🧪 **Testcontainers** | Integration testing with real dependencies in Docker |
| 🐘 **PostgreSQL** | Relational database used in services |
| 🐳 **Docker & Docker Compose** | Containerization and orchestration for local dev |

## 🧱 Architecture

This project follows a **microservices architecture** with the following layers:

- **Gateway Layer**: Entry point for all client requests
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and data access
- **Discovery Layer**: Service registration and lookup
- **Config Layer**: Centralized configuration
- **Observability Layer**: Tracing, logging, and monitoring
